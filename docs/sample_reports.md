## Report annotations

To help auditing teams review findings, consider the following annotations
for each finding:

- `vendor`: The analytics vendor or keyword match.
- `asset_type`: Script, image, iframe, or link.
- `purpose`: Analytics, advertising, monitoring, or other.
- `consent_required`: Whether explicit user consent is required.
- `data_retention`: Retention policy for data collected by the tracker.

## Example annotation format

```
{
  "vendor": "Google Analytics",
  "asset_type": "script",
  "purpose": "analytics",
  "consent_required": true,
  "data_retention": "14 months"
}
